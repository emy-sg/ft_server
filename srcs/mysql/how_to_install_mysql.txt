# How To Install Mysql Service :

# Time to install Mysql Server without prompt (cuz it will ask for a password to be entered in the console).
#			$ apt-get install mysql   :// wont work cuz the repository of mysql does NOT exist on debian.


################################### COMMAND LINE INSTALLATION #################################################
#
# STEPS FOR A FRESH Installation of MySQL :

# 1- Adding the MySQL APT Repository :
#
#   Add the MySQL APT repository to your system's software repository list.
#			$ wget http://repo.mysql.com/mysql-apt-config_0.8.13-1_all.deb

# 	// How do I use wget :
#			$ apt-get install wget -y

#		Copy the URL for a file you'd like to download in your browser.
#		Now head back to the Terminal and type "wget" followed by the pasted URL.
#		The file will download, and you'll see progress in realtime as it does.
#
#	==> GNU Wget is a computer program that retrieves content from web servers.


#	//	Release Package :
#		==> release : allow or enable to set free.
#					the action or process of releasing product to be available.
#		==> A "Release Package" is a set of configuration items that will be build, tested and deployed together as
#				a single release.


# Follow these steps:

#	a- Go to the download page for the MySQL APT repository at http://repo.mysql.com/mysql-apt-config_0.8.13-1_all.deb.

#	b- Select and download the release package for your Linux distribution.

#	c- Instal the download release package with the following command, "dpkg -i " with the name of the downloaded package.

#	d- During the installation of the packages, you will be asked to choose the versions of the MySQL server
#      and other components that you want to install, and after making the choices for all components, choose OK to finish
#		the configuration and installation of the release package.

#	e- Update package information form the MySQL APT repository with the following command :
#			 $ apt-get update
#
# ==> Once the MySQL APT repository is enabled on your system, you will no longer be able to install any MySQL packages from
#		your platform's native software repositories until the MySQL APT repository is disabled.
#


# 2- Installing MySQL with APT :

# Install MySQL by the following command :
#			$ apt-get install mysql-server

# ==> This command installs the package for the MySQL server, as well as the package for the client and for the database common file.
# ==> During the installation, you are asked to supply a password for the root user for your MySQL installtion.
# --> Make sure you remember the root password you set.


# 3- Starting and Stopping the MySQL Server :

# The MySQL server is started automatically after installation.
# You can check the status of the MySQL server with the following command :
#			$ service mysql status  or $ service --status-all

########################################## NONINTERACTIVE MODE ###########################################################
#
# We gonna use deb-conf for noninteractive mode installation.

# STEPS FOR NONINTERACTIVE Installation of MySQL :

#	$ apt-get install wget -y

#	$ wget http://repo.mysql.com/mysql-apt-config_0.8.13-1_all.deb

#	$ apt-get install lsb-release -y

#	$ apt-get install gnupg -y

#	$ dpkg -i mysql-apt-config_0.8.13-1_all.deb

#	$ apt-get update

#	$ apt-get install mysql-server


# Use debconf :

#	After configuration "mysql" for first time, we can use "debconf-get-selections" to get the preconfiguration of the software from debconf database.

# 	It is provided by debconf-utils package, so you need to install it manually.

#	debconf: delaying package configuration, since apt-utils is not installed.

#	We can install the debconf-get-selections tool to see what possible selections a package may have.

#			$ apt-get install -y debconf-utils
#
#	Then find debconf related to MySQL:

#			$ debconf-get-selections | grep mysql

# ==> We'll see a few listed, including the configuration used for setting the root password.
# This is useful for installing any package that may have prompts or configuration asked. They can be set ahead of time!

#
#####################################################################################################################


===> AFTER getting the preconfiguration answers for installtion, you can run your script and it will work just as expected:


  $ apt-get install wget -y

  $ apt-get install lsb-release -y

  $ apt-get install gnupg -y


# You will need debconf-get-selections on a source system on which you want to read values from the debconf database.

# debconf-set-selections : Insert new values into the debconf database.

  $ apt-get install -y debconf-utils


### DON'T USE "ENV DEBIAN_FRONTEND noninteractive" on the Dockerfile ###

	# $ export DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive

# $ debconf-set-selections <<< "mysql-community-server	mysql-community-server/re-root-pass	password"

  $ wget http://repo.mysql.com/mysql-apt-config_0.8.13-1_all.deb


# dpkg is used to install, remove, and inspect .deb software packages.

# The -i flag indicates that weâ€™d like to install from the specified file.

  $ dpkg -i mysql-apt-config_0.8.13-1_all.deb
